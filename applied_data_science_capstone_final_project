1. Introduction

I am planning to open a Korean Barbecue (KBBQ) restaurant in Orange County, California. 
I am flexible on location so before determining where to rent I want to find a location in Newport Beach 
or Irvine. As everyone knows, KBBQ is most delicious after several beers, so I also want to find a location that is near bars but not near other Korean Barbecue restaurants. 
The Target audience of this report is anyone who is considering opening a Korean Barbecue Restaurant in Newport Beach, 
Irvine, California.

2. Data

To explore the two cities, I will be utilzing location data from Ciclt and Opendata. To examine the competition I will be extracting data from
from foursquare to look at the frequency of different venue types and the location of each venue within the neighborhoods of each 
city.

3. Methodology

To begin I extracted the orange county zip codes from http://www.ciclt.net/sn/clt/capitolimpact/gw_ziplist.aspx?FIPS=06059, and US latitude and longitude from 
https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude/download/?format=csv&timezone=America/New_York&lang=en&use_labels_for_header=true&csv_separator=%3B.
Next I clensed the data to include only the zip codes for Newport and Irvine, and only the latitude and longitude for those zip codes. 
I then merged the location data to get the necesary information to extract the bar and KBBQ venue data from foursquare. 
I extracted the venue data from foursquare and created seperate dataframes for Newport Bars, Newport KBBQ, Irvine Bars, and Irvine KBBQ. 
Finnally I mapped all four dataframes.

4. Results

When the results were finnally mapped I had a clear destintion for my new restaurant. Newport currently has zero Korean Barbeque restaurants while Irvine has six. 
In addition to the lack of competition in Newport, there are no bars as defined by foursquare in Irvine. 

5. Discussion 

While there was a clear answer based on the parameters that I set fourth in my introduction there are additional questions raised by the results. 
Is there a reason why there are no KBBQ restaurants in Newport today? Is there a reason that there are no bar in Irvine? Is the lack of bars in Irvine another 
business opportunity that should be explored?

6. Conclusion

Finally my conclusion, based on my the goal raised in the introduction is to open a KBBQ restaurant on the Newport peninsula. 
As the only KBBQ restaurant in the area competition was not a factor, proximity to a bar on the other hand was a challenge. 
This ladder challenge restricts my potential site to the Newport peninsula and it's surroundings.
