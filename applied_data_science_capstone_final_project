1. Introduction

I am planning to open a Korean Barbecue restaurant in Orange County, California. 
I am flexible on location so before determining where to rent I want to find a location in Newport Beach, 
Irvine, or Tustin that is near bars but not near other Korean Barbecue restaurants. 
Additionally I want to compare the cities to determine any distinctions between the three. 

2. Data

To complete the assessment I will be utilizing data from foursquare to look at the frequency 
of different venue types within the neighborhoods of each city.
